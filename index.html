		<h2>About VEGA (Voice Entity for Guiding Astronauts)</h2>
		<p>Astronauts, whether on the ISS, moon, or other EVA, frequently need both hands free to complete mission tasks. Inspired by Iron Man's JARVIS, VEGA is 
			leverages conversational AI methods to provide the user with hands-free access to any necessary information. Currently, VEGA leverages the open-source
			 Rasa conversational AI platform. Using a dedicated conversational AI platform as opposed to a keyword recognizer that looks for certain phrases allows 
			 astronauts to use diverse language in making their request. This means that saying "How much water do I have left?" can be interpreted just as well as 
			 "What's that status on my H20" without any additional work. The system can provide the status on the astronaut's suit supplies or the astronaut's 
			 bioinformatics. The user can also inquire more information about their next tasks. A stretch goal of this project is to integrate VEGA with a system such 
			 as ATLAS.</p>

		<h2>About the Collaborative Lab for Work in Space</h2>
		<p>CLAWS (Collaborative Lab for Advancing Work in Space) is a multi-disciplinary group at the University of Michigan that designs and develops innovative 
			applications for human space exploration. The team consists of undergraduate and graduate students from CoE, LSA, and SI, and is guided by faculty advisors. 
			Past projects have included an augmented reality (AR) system to assist astronauts on the ISS, an AR toolkit for surface exploration, and a voice assistant 
			to make information more easily accessible. CLAWS is focused on creating human-centered, software-driven applications to advance humanity's presence in 
			space.</p>
